            Further, the Respondent in this statement filed on 30.04.2024, gave
            additional details, of 21 Invoices, stated to be raised by the Claimant for
            Assessment, for the sum of Rs.95,78,466/- (inclusive of TDS), and details
            of 10 Invoices, stated to be raised by the Claimant on account of
            mobilisation amount, for which Rs.25,44,554/- was paid to the Claimant,
            even though this was beyond the directions contained in the order of
            26.04.2024. Thus, as per the statement furnished on 30.04.2024, the
            Respondent paid the total sum of Rs.97,15,509/- to the Claimant on
            account of Invoices raised for Assessment, while the balance payment of
            Rs.25,44,554/- was paid towards the Invoices raised for Mobilization.

            Thus, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has been paid the total
            amount of Rs.1,22,60,063/-, which was far in excess to the amount which
            was payable and paid to the Claimant on account of his
            professional/assessment fee alone. The Respondent, further, on the basis
            of this statement, sought to contend that the Claimant had only raised
            these Invoices and for which the total amount stand paid.

            The Tribunal however does not agree with the contention put forth
            by the Respondent that only 21 Invoices to the tune of Rs.95,78,466/-
            were raised by the Claimant on account of assessment fee. The
            Reconciliation Sheet for Billing, Payment and TDS to the Claimant, filed
            on 30.04.2024, in compliance of the order of this Tribunal passed on
            26.04.2024, was compared with the Invoices placed on record by the
