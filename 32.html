        Respondent. The matter was therefore listed for the purpose of
        reconciliation of accounts and further clarifications on 11.04.2024, when
        the Counsel for the Claimant, on instructions from his client, admitted to
        have received all these payments. The Tribunal further noted that in the
        evidence affidavit of Mr. Sharad Kapoor, RW-1, filed on behalf of the
        Respondent, it has been stated that the Claimant had even raised various
        invoices of conveyance and mobilization amount which amounts were
        also paid to the Assessor/Claimant and that the sum of Rs.1,17,52,433/-
        included the sums paid to the Claimant on account of conveyance and
        mobilization account. The Tribunal therefore vide its order dated

        amounts deducted from these payments. The Respondent, in compliance
        with the order of 26.04.2024, filed the requisite details on 30.04.2024 and
        segregated the sum of Rs.1,17,52,433/-, reflecting that a sum of
        Rs.25,44,554/- has been paid to the Claimant on account of mobilisation
        amounts while the balance sum of Rs.92,07,879/- has been paid to the
        Claimant for his professional services/assessment fee. Another sum of
        Rs.5,07,630/-, was shown as TDS deducted from the professional fee.
        Thus, the sum of Rs.1,17,52,433/- did not include the amount of TDS to
        the tune of Rs.5,07,630/- which was deducted from the professional/
        assessment fee and paid to the authorities on behalf of the Claimant by
        the Respondent. Thus, according to the new calculation given by the
