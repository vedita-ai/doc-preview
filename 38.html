Respondent in its Statement of Defence. The Respondent for the first time
in its application dated 12.06.2023, for taking on record additional
documents, and subsequently in the evidence affidavit filed by RW1, Mr.
Sharad Kapoor, had taken this plea of adjustment. It is the settled law that
no party can lead evidence which is beyond its pleadings and hence this
new plea which nowhere finds mention in the statement of defense cannot
be entertained. Even otherwise, the Respondent in its application dated
12.06.2023, has admitted that the Claimant had raised various invoices of
conveyance and mobilization amount paid to the assessor and the said
amount was paid to the Claimant as per the discussion between the
Claimant and the Respondent. Thus, it is clear that the Respondent had
itself agreed to pay and indeed paid for these sums and hence cannot be
permitted to take a ‘U’ turn and seek adjustment of these payments from
the assessment fee paid, on the ground that they do not form part of the
Contract. Thus, the additional defense raised by the Respondent is also
without merits, is misconceived and rejected by the Tribunal.

In view of the aforesaid findings reached by the Tribunal, the
Tribunal now proceeds to decide the various claims filed by the Claimant.
