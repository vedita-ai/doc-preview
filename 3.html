        04.02.2019, stating that the reconciliation sheet send by the Petitioner was flawed and
        as per the Respondent’s calculation the total outstanding due was only Rs.18,33,287/-.
        As per the Claimant, the Respondent, vide another official communication email dated
        18.02.2019, stated that as per the Respondent’s calculation, the total outstanding due
        was only Rs.16,98,370/-. The Claimant, however, wrote an email dated 19.02.2019 in
        reply to email dated 18.02.2019 and explained his position that as per his calculations,
        the outstanding dues were above Rs.22 lakhs.

        The Claimant further states that thereafter, several reminders and mails were sent by
        the Claimant to the Respondent through its concerned officials for at least clearing the
        outstanding dues of Rs.16,98,370/-, which were due and outstanding to the Claimant as

        Respondent to the Claimant and even though thereafter the Claimant made each and
        every effort to reach out to the Respondent and its officials in order to get his
        outstanding dues of Rs.14,25,457/- (as per Respondent’s calculations) cleared but all
        his efforts went in vain and no further payment was received from the Respondent. The
        Claimant therefore wrote several mails dated 09.01.2020, 14.12.2020, 30.05.2021,
        asking the Respondent both to settle Claimant’s claim and invoking arbitration but no
        reply to the same was ever received from Respondent’s end. The Claimant, as per

        arbitration proceedings between the said parties, that is, the Claimant and the
