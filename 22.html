        placed on record the reconciliation sheet which was filed as part of
        additional documents on 12.06.2023. The said sheet clearly reflects that
        the sum of Rs.16,98,370/, inclusive of TDS was due and payable to the
        Respondent, as per the Claimant’s own accounts. As per the Tribunal, the
        same clearly amounts to acknowledgement of debt on behalf of the
        Respondent. Even though during the course of arguments it has been
        argued by the Counsel for the Respondent that the said emails do not
        amount to acknowledgements nor were the same made on behalf of
        competent persons, however, it is noted that no such plea was taken in the
        statement of defense or even in the evidence affidavit of RW1 nor any
        evidence was led to show that these emails were issued without any
        authority.

        ‘Acknowledgement’ has been dealt with in Section 18 of the Limitation
        Act, which states as hereinunder:
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>
            “<i>Effect of acknowledgment in writing.—(1) Where, before the
            expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in
            respect of any property or right, an acknowledgment of liability in
            respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed
            by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by
            any person through whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh
            period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the
            acknowledgment was so signed.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>(2) Where the writing containing the acknowledgment is undated,
            oral evidence may be given of the time when it was signed; but
            subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of
            1872), oral evidence of its contents shall not be received.</i>”
