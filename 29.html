        4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as laid down in the aforesaid judgment, a debtor, while
        admitting the existence of an account, may say that on account of
        payments which he has made, the balance of the account will be found to
        be in his favour. The Respondent, on the basis of document, Exhibit
        RW1/C, therefore contends that the Claimant had conducted an
        assessment of 46,5987 candidates for which he has been paid the full
        amount of Rs.99,69,747/- as per the pricing policy agreed between the

        deducting TDS. In response to the said contention, the Claimant in its
        Rejoinder filed invoices which he stated to have raised against the
        Respondent for the payment of his professional fee and/or mobilization
