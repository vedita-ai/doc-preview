        Further, the Court in the case titled “State Trading Corporation of India
        Ltd. vs. The Jay Shree Chemicals and Fertilisers and Ors. [AIR 1979 Cal
        374: 1979 SCC OnLine Cal 161]”, after going through various
        correspondences between the parties made the following observations:
    </p>

    <p class="indent para-27">
        “27. The Division Bench of Punjab High Court in this case inter
        alia relied on AIR 1939 Mad 300 : AIR 1951 Trav Co. 93 and
        (1906) 33 Ind App 165 (PC) and held that <u>the admission of
        unadjusted account would amount to an acknowledgment of
        liability within the meaning of Section 19 of the Limitation Act.</u>
    </p>
    <p class="indent para-28">
        28. The Division Bench of the Punjab High Court in this case
        relied on paragraph 12 of (1906) 33 Ind App 165 (PC) :--
    </p>
    <p class="quote quote-28">
        “An acknowledgment of liability, should the balance turn out to be
        against the person taking it, is a sufficient acknowledgment under
        Section 19 of the Limitation Act (XV of 1877) and there is no
        distinction in this respect between the English and the Indian
        Law.”
    </p>
    <p class="indent para-29">
        29. Commenting on the three aforesaid decisions the Division
        Bench held:
    </p>
    <p class="quote quote-29">
        “<u>The ratio decidendi, however, of all these cases is that where the
        debtor has admitted the existence of an account, it must be deemed
        to be an acknowledgment of liability for whatever is found due
        from him on the settlement of the account. A debtor, may while
        admitting the existence of an account also that on account of set
        off, which he claims, nothing will be found due to the creditor, or
        may say that on account of payments which he has made, the
        balance of the account will be found to be in his favour. All the
        same, he would be deemed to have admitted the existence of the
        account and would be deemed to have acknowledged his liability
        to pay whatever money is found due on the basis of the said
        account.</u>”
