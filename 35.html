    rejoinder to argue that the invoices placed on record by the Respondent
    alongside his rejoinder were the only invoices raised by the Claimant,
    however, this argument is contrary to their own statement filed on
    30.04.2024, wherein details of additional invoices raised by the Claimant
    have been provided by the Respondent itself. The Tribunal therefore
    rejects the further contention of the Respondent that the total value of the
    invoices raised by the Claimant for assessment for these financial years
    was only Rs.95,78,466/- since the same is contrary to the Respondent's
    own statement.

    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question which needs to be considered by this Tribunal is
    whether the payment of the entire amount of Rs.97,15,509/- made to the
    Claimant, was on account of assessment fee. The Respondent has not filed
    any invoices to support that all 21 invoices were raised on account of
    assessment fee. However, the Claimant has filed some invoices, as stated
    hereinabove. The perusal of the invoices dt. 03.11.2017 for
    Rs.4,75,000/-, dt. 31.03.2018 for Rs.3,02,271/- and dt. 14.05.2018 for
    Rs.5,32,000/-, filed by the Claimant along with Rejoinder show that the
    same pertain to Mobilization expenses, local conveyancing etc. However,
    the same have been wrongly shown by the Respondent in the statement
    filed on 30.04.2024 as part of the 21 invoices raised for assessment only.
    It is therefore clear that the payments to the extent of these invoices, that
    is, Rs.13,09,271/- shall have to be deducted from the total amount of
    Rs.97,15,509/-, stated by the Respondent to be paid towards the
