        Ganga Singh (1929) I.L.R. 10 Lah., the same view was taken. It was held that <u>a suit on the basis of a balance was competent</u>. In Kahanchand Dularam v. Dayaram Amritlal I.L.R. 1929 10 Lah. 745, the same view was expressed and it was observed that <u>the three expressions "balance due", "account adjusted" and "balance struck" must mean that the parties had been through the account. The defendant there accepted the statement of account contained in the plaintiff's account book, and made it his own by signing it and it thus amounted to an "accounts stated between them" in the language of Article 64 of the Limitation Act. The same happened in the present case. The acknowledgment which forms the basis of the suit was made in the ledger of the plaintiffs in which earlier mutual accounts had been entered and truly speaking, the suit was not based merely on this acknowledgment but was based on the mutual dealings and the accounts stated between them and was thus clearly maintainable</u>. ”
