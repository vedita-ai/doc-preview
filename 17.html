        record these additional documents, where after the same were taken on record.
        The additional documents filed on record were stated to comprise of
        reconciliation sheets mentioned in the emails of 04.02.2019 and 18.02.2019.
        However, on perusal of these documents, it was found that even though the
        reconciliation sheet attached to the email dated 18.02.2019 was placed on record,
        however, no reconciliation sheet, which finds mention and annexed in the email
        of 04.02.2019, has been placed on record by the Respondent. However, 2
        attachments along with email dated 04.02.2019, that is, books of accounts as per
        India Skills and books of account as per Samim/Claimant, were placed on record.
        Since despite the specific directions of this Tribunal, the Respondent failed to
        place on record the reconciliation sheet attached to the email dated 04.02.2019,
        which reconciliation sheet would have disclosed the true state of affairs as to the
        Claimantâ€™s outstanding against the Respondent as on 04.02.2019, the Tribunal
        has no option but to draw an adverse inference against the Respondent that it was
        hiding something from the Tribunal. In fact, during the course of arguments, the
        attention of the Counsel for the Respondent was brought to the email of
        04.02.2019 and he was asked to explain as to why the figures, which were
        mentioned in items no. 1) to 5) and which were stated to be marked in red, could
        not be found/ traced in the additional documents filed by the Respondent
        subsequently, to which the Counsel for the Respondent had no answer except to
        state that the mail of 04.02.2019 comprised only of the 2 attachments. The
        Tribunal, however, notes that apart from these 2 attachments, there is another
        attachment (in jpg/pdf form) in the email of 04.02.2019. In fact, similar
