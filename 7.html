The Respondent, in its statement of defense, has further stated that since inception of the MoU, the Claimant has always been trying to misappropriate the accounts and cause wrongful loss to the Respondent. However, the Respondent has been maintaining computerized database of financial information programmer and the Respondent has been maintaining the ledger account for each and every client. The ledger account maintained against the Claimant is crystal clear and nothing is mismanaged by the Respondent. Further, even though the Claimant has claimed the outstanding amount of Rs.14,25,457/- in the present claim but he has not filed any invoices or account statement to this effect. His entire claim is based upon the email dated 18.02.2019, which was sent to the Claimant with request to adjust the escaped/left amounts. However, the Claimant has taken the stand that on the said email the cut-off date for calculation of the outstanding amount is Rs.18,33,487/-, which is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The Respondent has further contended that despite repeated requests and efforts, the Claimant did not turn out for the settlement of accounts nor provided the ledger account maintained by the Claimant, and had the Claimant approached with the ledger account maintained by him, the Respondent could have located the escaped amount maintained and settled the dispute smoothly. However, the Claimant neither supplied any statement of accounts to the Respondent nor bothered to file the same before this Hon’ble Tribunal. Thus, as per the Respondent, this Tribunal be pleased to dismiss the claims filed by the Claimant.
