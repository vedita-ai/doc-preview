of the statement, total fee has been mentioned as Rs.92,98,909/-, out of which
Rs.74,65,422/- has been stated to be paid and the balance sum of Rs.18,33,487/-
is shown to be the outstanding. This appears to be in consonance with the
outstanding sum of Rs.18,33,287/-, as per the ISPL, which finds mention in the
main body of the email. However, no reconciliation sheet mentioned in the email
of 04.02.2019 could be found in the additional documents even though the email
of 04.02.2019 shows another attachment (in jpg/pdf form) apart from the 2
attachments (in excel form). Similar attachment (in jpg/pdf form) can be seen in
the email of 18.02.2019 which is the reconciliation sheet and has been placed on
record by the Respondent.

<p>
The email of 04.02.2019, however, further records about various amounts
which have either not been considered by the Claimant in its books/accounts or
discrepancies in the Claimantâ€™s accounts, or amount which shall be reconsidered
by the Respondent in its books. Vide the said email, the Claimant has been asked
to make the necessary changes in his accounts. It is also clear that these changes
pertain to adjustments/deductions which the Respondent asked the Claimant to
make in his books of accounts (reflecting the sum of Rs.37,14,397/-) in respect
to items no. 1) to 5) mentioned in the said email. In reply to the email dated
04.02.2019, an email dated 08.02.2019 was sent by the Claimant to the
Respondent, which is reproduced hereinunder:
