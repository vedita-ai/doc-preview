        prevented the appellant from placing the said complaints on record or
        having the same summoned from the concerned authorities to whom they
        were addressed. <span class="underlined">Non-production of the documents admittedly available
        with the appellant that would lend credence to the version set up by the
        appellant that the incident of corrupt practice was reported to him and/or
        to his election agent would give rise to an adverse inference against the
        appellant that either such complaints were never made or if the same were
        made they did not contain any charge regarding the commission of
        corrupt practices by the respondent in the manner and on the dates and
        the places alleged in the petition. We may in this regard refer to
        illustration (g) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act which permits the Court
        to draw an adverse presumption against the party in default to the effect
        that evidence which could be but is not produced would, if produced, have
        been unfavourable to the person who withholds it. The rule is contained
        in the well-known maxim: omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem. If a
        man wrongfully withholds evidence, every presumption to his
        disadvantage consistent with the facts admitted or proved will be adopted.
        We need to remind ourselves that in an election dispute where oral
        evidence is generally partisan in character as has been demonstrated in
        the present case, the non-production of documentary material that could
        lend support to the appellant's charge of bribery against the respondent
        would assume great importance. Absence of a plausible explanation for
        non- production of the documentary evidence would completely discredit
        the version which the oral evidence attempts to support.</span>‚Äù

             The further contention of the Respondent that despite repeated requests
             and efforts, the Claimant did not turn out for the settlement of accounts
             nor provided the ledger account maintained by the Claimant, is also not
             borne out from the documents placed on record. Even though the
