witness, RW1, in his cross-examination also admitted that the Respondent had
business dealings with the Claimant for the years subsequent to 2015, that is,
2016 to 2019 on the basis of MoU dated 16.07.2015 and even the payment was
made to the Claimant as per the terms of the said MoU. It is therefore clear that
no termination of the MoU was done, and neither of the parties treated the MoU
to be null and void on account of alleged non-payment of the Coordinator
Registration and Renewal Fee by the Claimant. The Respondent was utilizing
the services of the Claimant for the entire period without any objection as to non-
payment of empanelment fee. The Claimant in its cross-examination in anfswer
to question no. 13 has stated that the Respondent gave him written instructions
through email on the basis of which he carried out the work after 15.06.2016.
Therefore, the Tribunal finds the said plea to be misconceived and the same is
rejected at the outset.

    The Tribunal finds that the entire claim of the Claimant is based on the two
    emails, dated 04.02.2019 and 18.02.2019 and therefore it becomes necessary to
    deal with the same in detail. The first email dated 04.02.2019 is addressed by
    Ms. Jyoti Ranjan Jena on behalf of the Respondent Company directly to the
    Claimant and the same is reproduced hereinunder:
