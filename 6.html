            of the total amount of Rs. 18,33,487/-, escaped amounts are to be excluded which was,
            TDS paid Rs.8,38,912/-, difference amount against revised charges per candidate
            Rs.4,04,150/-, Co-ordinator Registration & Renewal Fees Rs.2,00,000/- (wrongly
            written as Rs.20,000/-) and the difference amount left in ledger accounts maintained by
            Claimant Rs.4,93854/-. However, the Claimant has ignored the email and repeatedly
            threatened to file false police complaint and civil suits against the Respondent instead
            of adjusting the escaped amount from the outstanding amount of Rs. 18,33,487/-, which
            he was legally liable to adjust as per the terms and conditions of MoU. Thus, as per
            Respondent, after deducting the escaped amounts, the balance of Rs.2,72,913/- was
            shown due against the answering Respondent which was settled on 18.10.2019 and the
            accounts were closed.

            The Respondent further states that the Claimant has not filed a single document
            pertaining to his claim, that is, receipts, ledger statement, invoices etc. That the
            Claimant has violated Clause 2(p) of the MoU wherein he failed to provide any detailed
            report of the assessment along with the mandate report of the (i) attendance copy of the
            assessment done, (ii) photographs of the candidates, (iii) photographs/Videos of
            assessments being carried out, (iv) Detailed Result Sheet of the Candidates assessed,
            (v) Copy of the work order against which the assessment was carried out and (vi) the
            bills against each work order along with the above collaterals. The Claimant has filed
            only the communications made between the Respondent and Claimant, which are not
            conclusive and concrete evidence for the relief as claimed by the Claimant and therefore
            he may be directed to put strict proofs.
