            As stated hereinabove, the reconciliation sheet mentioned in the email of
            18.02.2019 has been filed by the Respondent along with the additional
            documents on 12.06.2023. The reconciliation sheet shows that as per the
            Tracker, the total share of the Claimant was Rs.99,69,748 (inclusive of TDS) out
            of which payment of the sum of Rs.82,71,378/- has been done by ISPL to the
            Claimant and the dues have been shown to be Rs.16,98,370/-. The Claimant,
            however, disputed this due amount of Rs.16,98,370/- by sending another email
            of 19.02.2019 by stating that as per his calculation, the total outstanding balance
            was more than Rs.22 Lakhs and thereby requested the Respondent to once again
            calculate his total outstanding balance, to which no reply was ever received from
            the Respondent. The Tribunal thus finds that the accounts were duly reconciled
            after exchange of emails and balance shown as per books of accounts of both the
            parties. Even though it is correct that the Claimant was not agreeable to the
            balance outstanding amount as calculated by the Respondent, however, as per
            the Respondent, the total outstanding balance of Claimant was Rs.1698370/- as
            on 18.02.2019. It is also clear that the difference in the outstanding balance was
            largely on account of difference in the sharing rate of coordinators fee. The
            Tribunal also notes that subsequent to the email of 19.02.2019 sent by the
            Claimant to the Respondent to have a re-look into the accounts, no further mail
            was written by the Respondent meaning that it stuck to its position of outstanding
