    <p>
        In view of the discussion made hereinabove, outstanding sum payable by
        the Respondent to the Claimant was Rs.12,28,107/-. There is no contract
        between the parties for the payment of any interest to the Claimant on
        account of late or non-payment by the Respondent. The Claimant is
        therefore not entitled to any pre-litigation interest. At the same time, there
        is no bar to the payment of interest as well. The Tribunal is of the view
        that the Respondent, who is a small entrepreneur, has been illegally and
        unjustifiably denied the payment of the sums due to him by the
        Respondent Company. Therefore, this Tribunal holds the Claimant to be
        entitled to pendent-lite interest @ 12% per annum on the aforesaid
        balance outstanding sum with effect from the date when the present
        arbitration proceedings were invoked by legal notice dated 06.09.2021 till
        the date of the passing of the present Award.

        <span class="underlined">Claim No. 4 for cost of Arbitration</span>
    </div>

    <p>
        The cost for the conduct of the present arbitration proceedings was to be
        shared between the parties. However, the Respondent failed to deposit its
        share of arbitration fee, which was subsequently paid by the claimant.
        Since the Claimant has succeeded in his claim, the Tribunal therefore
        awards the entire cost of arbitration that has been paid by the Claimant,
