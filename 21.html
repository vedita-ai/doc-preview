Rs.22 Lakhs, no further mail or evidence has been brought on record to
show that there was change of the stand on the part of the Respondent.

difference in the outstanding balance was largely on account of difference
in the sharing rate of coordinators fee. The Tribunal also notes that

the Respondent to release the payment to him. Therefore, it is wrong to
contend on the part of the Respondent that the Claimant did not turn out
for the settlement of accounts, nor provided the ledger account maintained
by the Claimant, nor supplied any statement of accounts to the
Respondent. The email of 18.02.2019 issued by the Respondent to the

were not considered by the Respondent while giving the outstanding sum
of Rs.18,33,287/- payable to the Respondent. The Respondent has further
