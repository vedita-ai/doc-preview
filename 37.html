        the said sum of Rs.99,69,747/-. This Tribunal agrees that the Claimant
        should have done proper home-work at the time of filing his statement of
        claim which should have been duly supported by the proper
        documents/invoices, but it is also clear that the Respondent has also not
        come clean on the issue.

        Nevertheless, the Tribunal has already accepted the alternative
        plea of the Claimant based on the acknowledgement of his dues by the
        Respondent in the email of 18.02.2019 wherein the Claimant's final
        outstanding balance of Rs.16,98,370/- has been mentioned. As per the
        reconciliation sheet, this figure of Rs.16,98,370/- has been arrived at by
        deducting the sum of Rs.82,71,378/- from the total Coordinator's share of

        added to the sum of Rs.82,71,378/-, the total payment made to the
        Claimant comes to Rs.86,80,747/-. The deduction of this sum of
        Rs.86,80,747/- from the total share of Coordinator's fee of Rs.99,69,748/-
        leaves the balance sum of Rs.12,28,107/-, to be paid by the Respondent
        to the Claimant.

        The Respondent has further sought to contend that the amount paid
        to the Claimant/Assessor towards the mobilisation and conveyance
        should be adjusted in the overall amount that was due to the Claimant for
        the assessment of the candidates, which contention cannot also be
        accepted for two reasons. First, no such defense was taken by the
