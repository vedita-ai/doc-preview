balance of Rs.16,98,370/- as on 18.02.2019 even though several mails were
written by the Claimant to the Respondent requesting the Respondent to release
the payment to him.

<p>
The Respondent, in its defense in the written statement, filed in reply to
the Statement of Claim, has, however, contended that as per the email dated
04.02.2019, sent by the Respondent to the Claimant, it was the outstanding
amount of Rs.18,33,487/- which was subjected to further adjustments/
deductions, as detailed in items no. 1) to 5). Thus, as per the Respondent, when
the adjustment of these sums of Rs.4,93,854/-, Rs.2,00,000/-, Rs.8,38,912/- and
Rs.4,04,150/-, is done from the outstanding amount of Rs.18,33,487/-, the
balance amount comes to Rs.2,72,913/-, which amount was subsequently paid to
the Respondent on 18.10.2019 and accounts with the Respondent were thus
settled and closed. As per the Claimant, the said explanation of the Respondents
suffers from fallacy since the total of the aforesaid sums comes to Rs.19,36,916/-
which in excess of the sum of Rs.18,33,487/-, from which it was to be adjusted
and hence there was no occasion for the Respondent to pay the sum of
Rs.2,72,913/- to the Respondent on 18.10.2019. For this, the Counsel for the
Claimant relies on the cross-examination of the Respondent's witness, RW1, Mr.
Sharad Kapoor. Mr. Sharad Kapoor in answer to questions no. 12 & 14 has
maintained the stand that further adjustments/deductions, which find mention in
the email of 04.02.2019, were to be made from the outstanding balance of
Rs.18,33,487/-, as mentioned in email of 04.02.2019 and also from the balance
of Rs.16,98,370/-, mentioned in email of 18.02.2019. The Tribunal agrees with
