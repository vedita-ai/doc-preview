the contention of the Claimant that since the balance outstanding after the
adjustment of these sums comes in negative, there was no justification for the
Respondent to mention that the sum of Rs.18,33,487/- was outstanding as per
ISPL books in the email of 04.02.2019 and further that as per the data with the
finance, the Claimant's total outstanding balance was Rs.16,98,370/-, in the
email of 18.02.2019. Also, if these sums were to be adjusted further from the
outstanding sum of Rs.18,33,487/- or Rs.16,98,370/-, the balance due to the
Claimant would be in negative and the same does not explain why the
Respondent made further payments of the sum of Rs.2,72,913/- on 18.10.2019
and of Rs.1,36,456/- on 10.01.2020 to the Claimant. Thus, the construction put
forth by the Respondent to the email of 04.02.2019 cannot be accepted.
However, since as per the email dated 04.02.2019, the Respondent mentioned
that further adjustment was to be made in ISPL books on account of item no. 4),
that is, ‘Mismatches of candidates’, as also that Rs.2,50,000/- (instead of
Rs.2,00,000/-) shall have to be adjusted on account of Coordination Registration
and Renewal fees, in the subsequent mail, the outstanding sum of Rs.18,33,287/-
cannot be considered to be the final balance outstanding to the Claimant as on
04.02.2019. However, as per the Respondent’s subsequent email dated
18.02.2019, as per the data with the finance, the Claimant’s total outstanding
balance was Rs.16,98,370/-. The Tribunal finds that this was the final balance
outstanding to the Claimant as on 18.02.2019, as per the Respondent’s books
and the final figure seems to have been arrived after making the additional
adjustments which were mentioned in the previous mails.
