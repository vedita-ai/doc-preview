<u>1971 ((1971) 1 SCC 67 : AIR 1971 SC 1482) that the admission of
an existing unadjusted account by a party to the account will
operate as an acknowledgment of liability as well as the admission
of subsisting jural relationship between the parties to the said
account. On the basis of these authorities, I hold that all the letters
relied on by the plaintiff are acknowledgments of liability by the
defendant.</u>”

Thus, applying the above law to the facts of the present case, it is clear
that both the emails of 04.02.2019 and 18.02.2019 amount to
acknowledgment of liability on the part of the Respondent. Even though
the acknowledgement given in email of 04.02.2019 was conditional since
the outstanding sum of Rs.18,33,287/- was subject to further
reconsideration by the Respondent, the acknowledgment given in the
email of 18.02.2019 stating the balance outstanding to be Rs.16,98,370/-
was an unconditional acknowledgment and an implied promise to pay the
said amount by the Respondent to the Claimant could be inferred from
the same. The Tribunal also finds that in the Reply filed by the
Respondent to the Arbitration Petition No. 1220/2021 filed by the
Claimant for the appointment of the Arbitrator before the Hon’ble High
Court of Delhi, wherein the Claimant has mentioned about the email dated
18.02.2019 and the Respondent’s calculation of the total outstanding dues
of Rs.16,98,370/-, the Respondent has duly admitted that the said
outstanding amount was the amount that was due to the Respondent in
2019.
