            Rs.16,98,370/-. The Claimant has also relied upon the cross-examination
            of RW1, Mr. Sharad Kapoor, wherein in reply to ques. no. 13, the said
            Respondent's witness has admitted that Mr. Umesh Kumar is the
            employee of the Respondent Company. This Tribunal in view of the
            discussion made hereinabove has already held that the email of
            18.02.2019 amounts to an unconditional acknowledgement of debt of
            Rs.16,98,370/- and there is an implied promise to pay the same by the
            Respondent to the Claimant. The Claimant has, however, admitted the
            receipt of the sum of Rs.2,72,913/- from the Respondent on 18.10.2019.
            Further, in the hearing of 11.04.2024, the Claimant admitted to have
            received all the payments which were mentioned in Exhibit RW1/D
            (colly.). The details of payments made to the Claimant show that after the
            acknowledgement of balance outstanding of Rs.16,98,370/- to the
            Claimant by mail of 18.02.2019, the Respondent apart from the aforesaid
            sum of Rs.2,72,913/-, also paid a further amount of Rs.1,36,456/-. Thus,
            the sum of Rs.1,36,456/- further ought to be deducted from the claim
            amount to Rs.14,25,457/-, which leaves the balance sum of
            Rs.12,28,107/-, to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant. This
            Tribunal therefore awards the sum of Rs.12,28,107/- in favour of the
            Claimant and against the Respondent.
