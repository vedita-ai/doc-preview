        <p><u>Explanation.—For the purposes of this section,— (a) an acknowledgment may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the property or right, or avers that the time for payment, delivery, performance or enjoyment has not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, deliver, perform or permit to enjoy, or is coupled with a claim to set off, or</u> is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the property or right,</p>
        <p class="sub-point">(b) the word “signed” means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorised in this behalf, and</p>
        <p class="sub-point">(c) an application for the execution of a decree or order shall not be deemed to be an application in respect of any property or right.”</p>

The Judicial Commissioner took the view that an unqualified acknowledgment like the one in the suit, and the statement of the account under which the entry had been made, were sufficient to furnish a cause of action to the plaintiffs for maintaining the present suit. We are satisfied that no exception can be taken to this conclusion. It was held by the Privy Council in Maniram v. Seth Rupchand (1906) 33 I.A. 165, that <u>an unconditional acknowledgment implies a promise to pay because that is the natural inference if nothing is said to the contrary. It is what every honest man would mean to do.</u> In Fateh Chand v.
